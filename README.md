<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- ChatGPT

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Mac OS

<h2>Lab Steps</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
In this example we'll be asking ChatGPT to create us a list of common scenario of tickets to create in Zendesk. We'll first start with copying over our first scenario that ChatGPT created, but configure it in a way as if it was from a customer (end user). A customer who has a question about the availability of a product. As you can see shown below, that end user in this case 'John Doe' has created a ticket about a product inquire.

<p>
Now we can see that it is 'Assignee Help Desk Agent 1', before we were able to assign it, 'Ticket status' was showing 'NEW' due to it being received but not assigned. Now the status is showing 'OPEN' due to it being received and assigned to a group. It first showed it being assigned to the Merchant Group. Help Desk Agent 1 was given permissions to access all tickets that are submitted to the Merchant Group.

<p>
Now we will respond back to customer and review the 'Ticket status' change from 'Open' to 'Pending' due to us waiting for imformation from the customer.
